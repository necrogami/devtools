# devtools

> Pre-baked Docker toolbox image + per-project isolated compose stacks, orchestrated by a Go CLI (`dev`).

A personal **developer-host** system: run one SSH connection to a remote box, `docker exec` into any project's tools container, and find every tool you need already configured — bash + oh-my-posh, Claude Code, git, gh, db clients, and more. Language runtimes and project-specific libraries install on demand via a `Brewfile` at `/code/Brewfile` (Homebrew). Projects stay isolated from each other by design; the Homebrew cellar and download caches stay shared so spinning up a new project is fast.

## Why

Running many unrelated projects on one host gets messy: Node version conflicts, global Composer caches with cross-project dependencies, PHP extension drift, and the creeping anxiety that one project's tooling can observe another's code.

`devtools` gives each project its own sealed world:

- **Separate code volume**, separate home volume, separate network — a compromised project container can't see the others' source, shell history, or running services.
- **Shared Homebrew cellar + download caches** (brew, composer, npm, pnpm, cargo, go-mod, pip) mean first-run doesn't re-install every formula or re-download every dependency.
- **Agent-socket credential forwarding** — your SSH and GPG keys stay on the host; containers get sockets, never keyfiles.
- **One image, one CLI** — update the toolbox once; every project picks it up by pinning a date tag.

---

## Quick start

### 1. Install the `dev` CLI

```bash
# Option A: prebuilt binary (recommended for end-users)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/necrogami/devtools/main/install.sh | bash

# Option B: from source (Go 1.25+ required)
go install github.com/necrogami/devtools/cmd/dev@latest
```

Add `~/.local/bin` to your `$PATH` if it isn't already.

### 2. Clone this repo and bootstrap shared volumes

```bash
git clone git@github.com:necrogami/devtools.git ~/devtools
cd ~/devtools
dev init-shared    # creates 10 named volumes (brew cellar + 6 caches + 3 Claude), seeds Claude from ~/.claude
```

### 3. Pull (or build) the base image

```bash
# Pull the latest published image:
docker pull ghcr.io/necrogami/devtools:latest

# Or build it yourself:
dev build --tag local
```

### 4. Create your first project

```bash
dev new myproject              # scaffolds projects/myproject/
dev up myproject               # compose up -d
dev shell myproject            # docker exec -it myproject-tools bash -l
# inside the container:
claude login                   # one-time auth per project (work vs personal accounts possible)
```

That's it. Your new project has its own `/code` volume, its own shell history, and every tool from the base image on `PATH`.

```

Everything has `--help`; `dev completion {bash,zsh,fish}` prints completion scripts.

## How it works

### Image layers

| Layer | Contents | Cache behavior |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | apt packages (shell, interactive CLI tools, locale) — no language -dev libs | Rarely changes |
| 2 | Homebrew (Linuxbrew) prefix + pre-warmed taps | Monthly-ish |
| 3 | Modern CLI tools (yq, oh-my-posh, gh) + system shell init | Weekly-ish |
| 4 | Claude Code native binary | Most churn — stays on top |

The base image ships without PHP/Python/Ruby/Node/etc. — projects declare what they need via a `Brewfile` at `/code/Brewfile` and brew installs it on first `dev up`. The shared `devtools_brew` volume means formulae are installed once per host and reused.

### Per-project isolation

Each project gets its own compose stack with its own networks and volumes:

- `code:/code` — per-project, never shared
- `home:/home/dev` — per-project shell history, dotfiles, installed plugins
- `devtools_brew:/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew` — **shared Homebrew cellar** (formulae installed once per host, reused by every project)
- `devtools_{composer,npm,pnpm,cargo,gomod,pip}` — **shared download caches**
- `devtools_claude_{plugins,skills,commands}` — **shared "install once, use everywhere"**

Volume isolation means a compromised project container can't enumerate siblings, read their code, or trigger their shell history. Shared caches only contain **public package artifacts**, not secrets.

### Credential model

Private keys **never** enter any container:

| Credential | Host surface (discovered) | Container surface |
|---|---|---|
| SSH private keys | `~/.ssh/` | *not mounted* — agent socket only |
| GPG private keys | `~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/` | *not mounted* — agent socket only |
| SSH agent socket | `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK` | `/run/host/ssh-agent` |
| GPG agent socket | `gpgconf --list-dirs agent-socket`, falling back to `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gnupg/S.gpg-agent` → `~/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent` | `/run/host/gpg-agent` |
| GPG public material | `~/.gnupg/public-keys.d/` (gpg 2.1+), `pubring.kbx`, `trustdb.gpg`, `ownertrust` — whichever exist | read-only binds |
| gh token | `~/.config/gh/` | read-only bind |
| Git identity | `~/.gitconfig` | read-only bind |
| Claude config | `~/.claude/settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, `agents/` | read-only bind |
| Claude auth | *(never shared)* | `claude login` inside each project; token lives in per-project home volume |

A compromised container can *use* your agent during its lifetime (mitigated by `ssh-add -t 3600` and fine-grained gh PATs), but can't exfiltrate the key material itself.

### Host discovery + auto-generated override

The static `docker-compose.yml` in each project is host-agnostic — it defines the tools container and the shared/per-project volumes only. All credential and agent mounts are host-specific and are written out to `docker-compose.override.yml` (alongside the base file) every time `dev up` runs. Compose auto-loads the override, so `docker compose` commands against the project dir pick them up without extra flags.

`dev up` does two things before calling compose:

1. **`ensureHostPaths`** — touches missing `~/.claude/*` and `~/.config/gh/` so those bind sources always exist on a fresh host. Only devtools-specific paths are auto-created; credential paths (`.gnupg`, `.gitconfig`) are left alone and simply not mounted when absent.
2. **`internal/hostenv.Discover`** — probes the host for each credential source in turn (ssh-agent, gpg-agent via `gpgconf`, gpg keybox/pubring, gitconfig, gh dir, claude personalization) and returns only the paths that exist right now. The override renderer (`internal/compose.WriteOverride`) emits a bind-mount for every non-empty field.

That means `dev up` works on hosts without an ssh-agent, without gpg installed, on gpg 2.1+ (keybox dir) and legacy (pubring.kbx) alike, on macOS (Homebrew gpg socket paths) and Linux (systemd per-user runtime dir) — each host gets the subset that applies, and nothing fails when a piece is missing. The override file is `.gitignored` and can be deleted at any time; the next `dev up` rewrites it.

## Customization

### Adding runtimes + libraries to a project

Drop a `Brewfile` at `/code/Brewfile` (start from `Brewfile.example` in the scaffolded project):

```ruby
brew "php"
brew "php-tidy"
brew "mysql-client"
brew "imagemagick"
brew "ffmpeg"
brew "node"
brew "python@3.13"
brew "go"
```

The entrypoint runs `brew bundle install --file=/code/Brewfile` in the background on every container start. Formulae already present are no-ops; the `devtools_brew` shared volume means an install from project A is already warm for project B. Subsequent shells pick everything up via `$PATH` (Homebrew's `bin` is in `PATH` by default).

### Adding services

`projects/<name>/docker-compose.yml` has stubbed stanzas for MariaDB, Redis, and Mailpit. Uncomment, customize, `dev up <name>` again.

### Pinning a tool version

```bash
dev bump myproject --tag 2026-04-23  # pin to a specific dated image
dev up   myproject                   # pick up the new tag
```

To roll forward when you're ready:

```bash
dev bump myproject                   # defaults to today's date
dev up   myproject
```

### Updating the `dev` CLI itself

```bash
dev update --check          # report if a newer release is available
dev update                  # download, verify SHA-256, atomic replace
dev update --tag v0.2.0     # pin to a specific release
dev update --image          # also `docker pull` the latest base image
```

### Multi-account Claude Code

Because each project has its own `home` volume and does its own `claude login`, you can authenticate with your work account in `work-project` and your personal account in `side-project` without juggling.

---

## Development

Requires Go 1.25+ and Docker (with buildx).

```bash
# Build the CLI locally
go build -o dev ./cmd/dev

# Run unit tests
go test ./...

# Build the base image locally
./dev build --tag local

# Run the post-build smoke test
./base/smoke-test.sh devtools:local
```

### Release flow

- **Image**: push to `main` touching `base/**` triggers a multi-arch build → `ghcr.io/necrogami/devtools:{latest,YYYY-MM-DD,sha-<short>}`.
- **CLI**: tag `v*.*.*` → GoReleaser builds linux/darwin × amd64/arm64 binaries into a GitHub Release.
